Correct! In a single-line arrow function, an explicit return statement is not required if youâ€™re simply returning an expression. When using the arrow function syntax without curly braces {}, JavaScript implicitly returns the result of the expression on the right of the arrow.

Examples of Single-Line Arrow Functions Without return
Single-Line Predicate to Check Even Numbers:

let isEven = (number) => number % 2 === 0;
Here, number % 2 === 0 is evaluated, and the result (true or false) is implicitly returned.
No return keyword is needed because the function is a single-line expression.
Single-Line Predicate with Curly Braces (Requires return): If you add curly braces {}, then you must use return explicitly.

let isEven = (number) => { return number % 2 === 0; };
In general:

Without curly braces ({}): Return is implicit.
With curly braces ({}): Return must be explicit.
This implicit return is a feature of arrow functions that can make them more concise, especially for simple predicates and single-expression functions.

In javascript you have two options
If you use { curly braces you hv to hv return function, otherwise no
